## Bitlydia
A simple clone of Bitly using a [Ruby Sinatra web skeleton](https://github.com/hollowaykeanho/sinatra-web-server/tree/heroku).

The project was my first web application ever, developed in 2016. The application is currently being hosted on Heroku: http://bitlydia.herokuapp.com/.

## Project Structure
Structure is similar to that of a RoR project, except that CSS files can be found in `/public`.
